# Finance MCP Server

A minimal MCP server built with Python that exposes two example tools: one to convert a company name into a stock symbol, and another to fetch financial data from Yahoo Finance. The project focuses on learning how to build and run an MCP serverâ€”using a simple financial scenario purely as a demo use case.
